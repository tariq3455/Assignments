Task : Let's say; you left a message in the past that prints a password you need. To see the password you wrote, you need to enter your name and the program should recognize you.
Write a program that 

#Takes the first name from the user and compares it to yours,
#Then if the name the user entered is the same as yours, print out such as : "Hello, Joseph! The password is : W@12",
#If the name the user entered is not the same as yours, print out such as : "Hello, Amina! See you later."



user_name = input("you need to enter your name: ")
 
while True:  
    if user_name == "Joseph":
        print("Hello, Joseph! The password is : W@12")  
    else:
        print("Hello, {} See you later.".format(user_name))
